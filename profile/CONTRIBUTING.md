# Contributing to the Nebula Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Nebula Project. We welcome contributions of all kinds — code, documentation, designs, tests, and bug reports. This document summarizes how to contribute and what to expect.

## Getting started

- Read the project README to understand goals and scope.
- Search existing issues and pull requests before opening a new one.
- For major changes, open an issue or design discussion first to get feedback.

## How to submit changes

1. Fork the repository and create a branch named with the pattern `type/short-description` (examples: `fix/input-focus`, `feat/settings-sync`).
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
3. Update or add tests and documentation as needed.
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) against `main` (or the target branch specified in the repository).

## Pull request guidelines

- Reference an issue when applicable and describe the motivation and implementation.
- Keep PRs focused on a single problem or feature.
- Ensure unit/integration tests pass and add tests for new behavior.
- If your change affects public APIs, include migration notes.
- Be responsive to review feedback and update the PR accordingly.

## Coding style

- Follow existing project style and conventions; be consistent with surrounding code.
- Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate tests.

## Branching and commits

- Use descriptive branch names and concise commit messages.
- Prefer rebasing or squashing to keep history readable (maintainers may squash on merge).

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

- Use the issue templates to report bugs or request features. Include steps to reproduce, environment details, and minimal examples when possible.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a Code of Conduct to foster an open and welcoming community. Please read `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## Questions

If you're unsure where to start, open an issue labeled `good first issue` or ask for guidance in the repository discussions.

Thanks for helping make Nebula better!
