# The Nebula Project

The Nebula Project is an open source initiative focused on building modern, controller-friendly desktop applications for the Steam Deck and PC.

Nebula applications are designed with a controller-first philosophy while remaining fully functional with keyboard and mouse. The goal is to bridge the gap between console-style user experiences and traditional desktop software, making powerful tools accessible in both handheld and desktop environments.

## Mission

The Nebula Project exists to:

- Build desktop-class applications that feel native on the Steam Deck  
- Treat gamepad input as a first-class interaction method  
- Maintain full usability with keyboard and mouse  
- Support modern desktop platforms such as Windows and Linux  
- Develop open source tools that are transparent, maintainable, and community-driven  
- Prioritize performance, clarity, and thoughtful user experience design  

---

## Project Scope

The Nebula Project serves as an umbrella for a growing collection of open source applications and shared technologies. These projects may include, but are not limited to:

- Desktop utilities optimized for Steam Deck usage  
- Developer tools and productivity software  
- Media and content creation tools  
- Shared UI systems and input abstraction layers  

Each project under the Nebula umbrella is developed independently while adhering to common design principles and standards.

## Design Philosophy

Nebula software follows a consistent set of principles:

- Controller-first, not controller-only  
- Clear and legible interfaces at handheld scale  
- Predictable navigation and input behavior  
- Platform-appropriate integrations  
- Minimal abstraction between the user and the tool  

The Steam Deck is treated as a primary target platform, not a secondary compatibility layer.
